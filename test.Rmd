## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r results='asis', echo = FALSE}
# summary(cars)
# library(frequencies)
devtools::load_all(".")
x <- freq(big5[[1]])
x <- x$flextables
# print(x$`x: Race - Chosen from a drop down menu`)
# class(x$`x: Race - Chosen from a drop down menu`)
cat(as.html(x$`x: Race - Chosen from a drop down menu`))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
